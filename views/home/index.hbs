                    Women need more foreplay than men think they do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You think you need to take your shirt off but don’t do it so soon because women don’t really care about seeing you totally naked. With a shirt on its hotter trust me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a woman tries to resist you playfully during sex its just a fun tease and they know you like a fun tease. (Now I mean playful resistance not the nonconsensual one coz everyone knows what that means and I don’t wanna get into that topic)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Men need to learn how to touch the clit because its real sensitive and hard touching doesn’t make anyone come faster it simply is a turn off. LEARN how to touch. Don’t go rubbing it aggressively, nothings going to come out of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let that expensive lingerie stay a little bit longer than taking it all off. That shit cost money. You can do stuff with that still on the woman. LEARN.
